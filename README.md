NOTE: If you get a false positive malware warning you can ignore it. If this makes you nervous use the standalone zip which wont trigger a false positive. I have tried to make sure false postives have been eliminated. But let me know if you get one. 

Tool to make it easier to update TZXDuino, CASduino and ArduiTape

Very Simple tool to use:

Step1: Plug your Device into the USB port

Step2: Open TZXduino Uploader and select the COM port

Step3: Choose which type of Arduino you use

Step4: Choose which Firmware you need

Step5: Display you are using

Step6: If you are using an LCD display with an I2C adapter you need to specify the I2C address

Step7: Upload

If you do not know the I2C address use an I2C scanner sketch to find out > https://playground.arduino.cc/Main/I2cScanner/

I'll try to keep updating it as and when new Firmwares get released
