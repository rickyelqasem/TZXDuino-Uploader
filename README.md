# TZXDuino-Uploader
Tool to make it easier to update TZXDuino, CASduino and ArduiTape

Very Simple tool to use:

Step1: Plug your Device into the USB port

Step2: Open TZXduino Uploader and select the COM port

Step3: Choose which type of Arduino you use

Step4: Choose which Firmware you need

Step5: Display you are using

Step6: If you are using an LCD display with an I2C adapter you need to specify the I2C address

Step7: Upload

If you do not know the I2C address use an I2C scanner sketch to find out > https://playground.arduino.cc/Main/I2cScanner/

I'll try to keep updating it as and when new Firmwares get released
